# nft-stagenfcore

nft-stagenfcore allows you to stage nf-core modules in a temporary library, and link this library to your module library. This allows tests for modules or subworkflows in organisational nf-core-style repositories to depend on nf-core modules, without having to incorporate the nf-core code into the repository.

Please read the [documentation](docs/usage.md) for more information.
